## 🚀 Overview

Vincent deploys AI agents that get smarter over time — and come with built-in secret management, spending policies, and an airgapped vault so you can trust them with real credentials and real money.

### Why Vincent?

Traditional AI agents are powerful but risky when it comes to handling sensitive operations. Vincent changes that by providing:

- **🧠 Self-Improving Agents**: Your AI agents learn and improve with every interaction
- **🔐 Built-in Secret Management**: Secure credential storage and access control
- **💰 Spending Policies**: Set guardrails to control how agents use resources

- **✅ Production-Ready**: Deploy AI agents you can trust with real credentials and real money

## 🎯 Features

- **Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions for what your agents can access

### Financial Safety
